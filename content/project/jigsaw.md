summary = "Given a directory of images of individual puzzle pieces, is it possible to programmatically determine the assembly configuration of the pieces? This was the challenge I took on with the Python wrapper of OpenCV and some photos of a simple jigsaw puzzle. Progress so far consists of identifying sides of a piece and classifying the type of a side: whether it has an extrusion or fits with the extrusion from another piece, or is part of the edge of the puzzle. Ongoing work is to find a way to compare the contour of an extrusion with the contour of a notch in another piece and identify which pair of pieces fits best."
