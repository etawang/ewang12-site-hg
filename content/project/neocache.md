summary = "Neocache is a chrome extension created at TartanHacks 2015 which allows users to annotate arbitrary content around the web. The image on the left shows a cut of a page that was annotated with many comments in the course of our testing. Annotations are marked with a small quill icon. Hovering over the icon displays the content \"cached\" at that location. When users activate the extension, they see content cached by themselves or other users. The extension comes with a dashboard page where users join and leave groups to filter which caches they see. The dashboard also provides users a way to manage caches that they have set."
