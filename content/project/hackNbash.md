summary = "Hack 'n' Bash, created by a team of four, is a webapp for visualizing the remote filesystem space allocated to CMU students. The user controls a robot using arrow keys. Each directory is a region. Files in a directory are represented by hopping sprites. Various Unix commands have analogous actions in this visualization. For example, the robot passes through portals to switch directories. Files can be deleted by the robot attacking them with a lightsaber. Unix commands implemented were scp, rm, ls, cd, and cat."
