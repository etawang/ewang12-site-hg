summary = "daOptimizer was a final partner project for 15-440 Distributed Systems. The focus of the project was to implement the Paxos consensus protocol. The application supported by our back end was a web platform for crowdsourced code optimization. Users would either upload code snippets to optimize, or submit optimizations to code entries. Submitted optimizations would be timed, tested for correctness, and accepted if they ran faster than current fastest implementation."
