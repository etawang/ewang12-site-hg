summary = "For 15-411 (Compiler Design), I worked with a partner to develop a compiler in Haskell for the C0 language (a more type-safe subset of C). Our compiler, when it compiled, compiled C0 code to x86-64 assembly, which could be converted to an executable using gcc. Stages of the compiler included parsing, lexing, intermediate code generation, register allocation, and assembly code gen. Supported language features included basic variables, functions, pointers, and arrays. For the final project, we implemented a (almost working) copying collector."
